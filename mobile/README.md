**FrameDetailsView**
Shows detailed information for a selected detection frame, including bounding boxes and VLM descriptions.

**SettingsView**
Allows configuration of app preferences, server URLs, and model options.

Initial landing screen for onboarding and navigation to other app sections.

## Deployment Target

- iPhone 12 and newer devices running iOS 18+

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riddhimanrana/orion
   cd orion/mobile
   ```

2. Download the YOLO11N and custom fine-tuned FastVLM coreml models:

   ```bash
   sh setup_models.sh
   ```

3. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```bash
   open Orion\ Live.xcodeproj
   ```

## Configuration

The file `Info.plist` contains auth endpoints and keys.

Feel free to replace them with your own database or authentication endpoints.

In addition, the folder `Configuration/Build.xconfig` contains a `DISAMBIGUATOR` configuration to make it easier to build and run a sample code project. Once you set your project's development team, you'll have a unique bundle identifier.

## Running the App

- Select a simulator or device in Xcode
- Press `âŒ˜`+`R` or click **Run**
